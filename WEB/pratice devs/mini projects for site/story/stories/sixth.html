            <div class="title">Mother Cara...</div>
            <div class="script"> 
                <p>
                    Cara was a single mother of three kids. They all lived in a one bedroom apartment in the dirtiest
                    neighborhood in the city. Cara had been fired from her job last month, rent was almost due, her
                    kids were all starving, and she didn't have medical for them when they got sick. <br><br>
                    She had to steal from farmers markets, sell herself, and beg. When her rent was due. She only
                    had $10 left to go. She tried to tell the landlord she only needed $10 more dollars. But he was
                    mean. He loved seeing people sad. He threw Cara and her kids out onto the streets. <br><br>
                    Everyday she walked alleyway to alleyway with her kids. Racing to homeless shelters. Most of the
                    time she was too late, so they had to sleep on the wet, cold, ground for three months. She stole
                    food and went hungry for weeks. She just wanted to keep her kids safe. <br><br>
                    One day her oldest son Henry broke out with a cold. She barely had any money. She tried to get
                    him some over the counter medicine, but she was always short. It turned out Henry had caught
                    the Swine Flu. He died the next week. <br><br>
                    Cara wanted to just give up. She wanted to cry so bad, but still she stood strong. She and her two
                    remaining kids traveled all over to find something or someone that would help them. One day a
                    nice woman seen them and said she would help them. <br><br>
                    She took them to her house and brought them in. It turns out she only tried to help the kids. She
                    called Children Services and took her children from her. She fought hard and strong to stop them.
                    The kids and her screams could be heard from down the street. <br><br>
                    They also took Cara to jail for negligence. She rotted in her jail cell for two months. Soon she got
                    sick. She knew it was bad but didn't want to tell the prison nurse. She knew they would help her,
                    and she wanted to die. Soon afterwards she got too sick to move, or be helped. <br><br>
                    She was taken to the hospital were she spent her last few hours. The family where her kids went
                    came to see her, her last day. They all stood by her bed as her timer ticked down. She hugged her
                    kids one last time and told them how much she loved them. Then she died. With a smile on her
                    face.
