                    Dear Diary, <br><br>
                    There's a girl, me, Anisha. I live in a small town where everyone thinks they know everything about
                    each other. But no one really knows what's going on behind my smile. <br><br>
                    My life isn't what it seems. It all started when I was just a kid. I saw something terrible,
                    something that took my parents away from me. Those memories haunt me like a shadow,
                    darkening every corner of my mind. <br><br>
                    After the accident, I went to live with my aunt and uncle. They tried their best, but nothing could
                    fill the emptiness inside me. At school, I was an outcast. Bullied for being different, for carrying a weight that no one else could see. <br><br>
                    Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months, but the sadness never left me. It was like a heavy fog, suffocating and relentless. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of sorrow, with no one to throw me a lifeline. <br><br>
                    But amidst the darkness, there was one glimmer of hope. My best friend, Meena. She was always
                    there for me, a ray of sunshine in my stormy world. She made me laugh when all I wanted to do
                    was cry, and she held me close when the pain became too much to bear. <br><br>
                    And then came that night. The night I lost her too. A drunk driver, a split-second decision, and she was gone. Just like that, my world shattered into a million pieces. <br><br>
                    Alone in my room, I poured out all my pain onto a piece of paper, a letter to Sarah that would
                    never reach her. Then I found myself on that bridge, overlooking the river. <br><br>
                    The wind whipped at my hair, and the cold bit at my skin, but I hardly noticed. With tears
                    streaming down my face, I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. In that moment, I made my
                    choice. <br><br>
                    As the world around me faded into darkness, I finally found the peace I had been searching for.
                    But for those left behind, my absence was a wound that would never fully heal. <br><br>
                    And in the end, as I let go of everything, I whispered her name into the wind, hoping that
                    somehow, someway, she would hear me. <br><br>
                    Forever in my heart, <br>
                    Anisha, 
                </p>
